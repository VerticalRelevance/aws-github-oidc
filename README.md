# AWS GitHub OIDC

An OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider for GitHub. The Provider is a resource you need in your AWS account to establish authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS, so that you can deploy resources to AWS from GitHub Actions without saving long-lived credentials in your GitHub Actions Secrets.
